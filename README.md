Welcome to my Data Analytics Capstone Project on IBM!

In this project, assuming myself as the Data Analyst for the company, I undertook the tasks of collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics.
Key requirements of analysis are identifying skills requirements for future, top programming languages, database skills in demand and IDEs in demand.
So each process in analysing the data is stored in the Jupyter notebooks that are uploaded.

Week 1: Data Collection
My first task is to gather a list of the most in-demand programming skills from job advertising, training websites, and polls, among other sources. In order to gather data in many formats like.csv files, excel sheets, and databases, I will start by scraping internet websites and using APIs.

Week 2: Data wrangling
Data wrangling techniques will be used to prepare the acquired data for analysis.

Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Once I've retrieved and cleaned enough data, I will use statistical methods to analyze the data.

Week 4: Data Visualisation
Involves creating charts and graphs to visualize the data

Week 5: Building a Dashboard
I'll use IBM Cognos Analytics to build a dashboard that will compile all of the data and nd spot trends and insights that might include the following: Which programming languages are most in demand today? What are the most in-demand database skills? Which IDEs are the most popular?

Week 6: Presentation of findings.
I use storytelling to share my findings in a presentation.
